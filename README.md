# spiralfuntoy
A spiral parsing toy program in Python

Take an array separated by spaces like:
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

And flatten it as if it was being spirally peeled like a potato into:
```
1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5
```

Or to think of it differently:
```
1 2 3
8 9 4
7 6 5
```

Output as:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Being careful to not be dependent on actual contents.
